              of operation, including by preventing violent conflict, increasing stability and protecting civilians, and
              building   and   fostering   sustainable   peace.   The   following   is   a   non-exhaustive   list   of   possible
              contributions a peace operation can make to promote these objectives, many of which can be among
              the   mandated   tasks   of   a   peace   operation.   Not   all   peace   operations   attempt   to   make   all   these
              contributions; the list is simply intended to suggest contributions that a researcher might look for in
              each case in order to help answer the question:
              <b data-v-438e0846>what effects did the peace operation produce?</b></p> <ul data-v-438e0846><li data-nav-id="1" class="about-getpos" data-v-438e0846><b data-v-438e0846>Preventing Conflict:</b>
              Prevention can take different shapes, comprise a wide range of actions
              and address conflict at different stages:
              <ul data-v-438e0846><li data-v-438e0846><i data-v-438e0846>Preventing/averting imminent escalation</i>
                  or outbreak of violence (direct prevention) means
                  preventing disputes from escalating into conflict, including mediation and local
                  conflict management e.g. leading or supporting national and local cease-fire or peace
                  agreements, supporting local peace agreements and local peace committees.
                </li> <li data-v-438e0846><i data-v-438e0846>Preventing the recurrence</i>
                    of conflict entails taking deterrent action to support a
                    cease-fire or truce implementation mechanisms and other forms of deterrence to
                    prevent recurrence of conflict.
                </li> <li data-v-438e0846><i data-v-438e0846>Indirect or structural prevention</i>, i.e. actions, steps or initiatives the peace operation
                  has taken to influence the underlying structural causes that generate risks to the civilian population.
                </li></ul></li> <li data-nav-id="2" class="about-getpos" data-v-438e0846><b data-v-438e0846>Building confidence:</b>
              Most activities of peace operations serve the underlying purpose of
              building confidence, i.e. to contribute to an environment that is conducive to fostering and
              increasing mutual confidence between the conflict parties or even within parties. Following a
              conflict, mistrust among communities and conflict parties may need to be dismantled before
              confidence can be developed. Confidence building is a key mechanism for repairing societal
              bonds after conflict and can be pursued through dialogue processes, capacity building or
              advocacy.
            </li> <li data-nav-id="3" class="about-getpos" data-v-438e0846><b data-v-438e0846>Stabilisation:</b>
              Enhancing stability is a core function of any peace operation, and includes how
              the presence and actions of a peace operation contribute to
              creating and maintaining a more
              secure environment at local,
              national and regional levels. Ensuring a secure environment is
              particularly relevant in areas where there may be residual conflict-related violence. In some
              cases, this may involve
              actions to counter, disrupt or neutralise armed groups.
            </li> <li data-nav-id="4" class="about-getpos" data-v-438e0846><b data-v-438e0846>Protecting civilians:</b>
              Since 1999, many peace operations have focused on the protection of
              civilians (PoC). PoC is a whole-of-mission endeavour where all components – military, police,
              and civilian – contribute to the implementation of the PoC mandate. PoC goes beyond
              protecting   civilians   from   immediate   physical   harm   through
              deterrence,   intervention   or offensive   operations
              and includes protection through dialogue and engagement, e.g.
              supporting   of  political  processes  or   conflict  management   and  reconciliation,   as  well  as
              creating protective environments by maintaining law and order or strengthening host-state
              security services that respect human rights and the rule of law.
            </li> <li data-nav-id="5" class="about-getpos" data-v-438e0846><b data-v-438e0846>Strengthening public safety:</b>
              Beyond the mere protection from crime, as this also refers to
              the welfare of the general public, including a range of issues such as traffic safety, harassment
              or natural disasters. Safeguarding public safety and a secure environment has been a core
              mandated task from the early days of peacekeeping and is based on the rationale that people
              will be more willing to engage in a peace process if there is some guarantee of their safety. For
              people living in (post)conflict areas, feeling safe is linked to the provision of public safety
              either through national security providers or the presence of an international peace operation.
              <i data-v-438e0846>Through which activities and engagements does the peace operation aim to strengthen public
              safety? How have these affected the perception of public safety?</i></li> <li data-nav-id="6" class="about-getpos" data-v-438e0846><b data-v-438e0846>Promoting   human   rights:</b>
              Conflicts   are   often   accompanied   by   serious   human   rights
              violations and impunity for the perpetrators. Peace operations engage in a host of activities,
              ranging from protecting and promoting
              human rights through long-term measures, such as
              strengthening human rights laws and associated legal practices, to reduce impunity and
              address associated grievances.
              As part of their shorter-term protection and stabilisation remit,
              tasks include monitoring human rights, empowering populations to demand respect for their
              rights, and enabling government institutions to fulfil their human rights commitments.
            </li> <li data-nav-id="7" class="about-getpos" data-v-438e0846><b data-v-438e0846>Preventing CRSV and SGBV:</b>
              The protection of women and men from sexual and gender-
              based/conflict-related sexual violence (SGBV/CRSV) during and after armed conflict is an
              essential part of the UN’s protection agenda. Preventing and addressing SGBV/CRSV is an
              integrated and prioritised element in a peace operation’s protection strategy.
            </li> <li data-nav-id="9" class="about-getpos" data-v-438e0846><b data-v-438e0846>Promoting national reconciliation:</b>
              National reconciliation  creates a  foundation  for  the
              lasting settlement of conflicts and is often a key element of the political process. While peace
              operations can provide the space (political or security) for a reconciliation process to take
              place, the process is unlikely to succeed unless national counterparts carry it forward and it is
              structured to address concerns, fears, and grievances of the population (see also
              ‘people-centred approaches’).
            </li> <li data-nav-id="10" class="about-getpos" data-v-438e0846><b data-v-438e0846>Contributing to peace dividends:</b>
              Peace dividends are the benefits accrued by the population
              from a peace process or peace operation. More immediate peace dividends can contribute to
              confidence in the political process and
              in the ability of communities to co-exist, as well as
              delivering tangible improvements for the population.
            </li> <li data-nav-id="11" class="about-getpos" data-v-438e0846><b data-v-438e0846>Extension   of   State  Authority   (ESA):</b>
              Extending   or   restoring   state   authority   means
              strengthening the state presence in more remote areas where the state has not been present or
              has been unable to deliver basic public goods. In the context of protection and stabilisation,
              the extension of state authority is often related to public safety and access to justice. Peace
              operations’ efforts on ESA often consist of building host-state institutions, particularly in the
              security and justice sectors, strengthening the rule of law and supporting community policing.
            </li> <li data-nav-id="12" class="about-getpos" data-v-438e0846><b data-v-438e0846>Supporting institution building and development:</b>
              Weak  institutions  and  poor   service
              delivery are both causes and consequences of conflict. Conflict aggravates the fragility of
              institutions, which are no longer able to function properly or take care of the day-to-day
              governing of the country. Institutions may also be bloated, lack capacity or be poorly managed
              or structured. Peace operations have increasingly taken on institution building in the areas of
              rule of law, in the security sector or as part of the extension of state authority. The aim is to
              empower host-state authorities to be effective national owners and drivers of a peace process.
              Institution building also forms part of an operation’s protection strategy, as institutions capable
              of protecting their own citizens are part of establishing a protective environment. Sustainable
              institution building requires resources (both financial and human) but also time.
            </li> <li data-nav-id="13" class="about-getpos" data-v-438e0846><b data-v-438e0846>Reforming/developing the security sector:</b>
              Ultimately, sustainable peace requires a security
              sector that is effective and is based on the rule of law. The security sector not only comprises
              uniformed personnel, but multiple structures and institutions that are responsible for their
              recruitment, management and oversight. And yet security-sector reform (SSR) goes beyond
              institutional development to also assist in the formulation of national security strategies and
              other policy and planning documents, as well as in fostering effective cooperative structures
              across   the   sector.   SSR   often   takes   a   comprehensive   approach,   also   engaging   with
              parliamentary oversight committees, civil society, and, at times, informal or non-state security
              providers.
            </li> <li data-nav-id="14" class="about-getpos" data-v-438e0846><b data-v-438e0846>Promoting the rule of law:</b>
              One element of promoting the rule of law addresses local
              institutions in the areas of justice, police, and corrections. But it also entails supporting the
              development, adoption and promulgation of legislation as well as in some cases drafting
              constitutions. For the population, access to justice is the fundamental concern and is often
              linked to the extension of state authority. A number of rule of law issues fuel conflict, such as
              disputed property and land rights or crime related to natural resources.
            </li> <li data-nav-id="15" class="about-getpos" data-v-438e0846><b data-v-438e0846>Supporting community policing:</b>
              Strengthening the relationship between host-state police
              and the communities they serve is central to fostering a protective environment that can ensure
              public safety in the long run. In addition to longer-term capacity and institution building
              support, community policing seeks involvement of communities in discussions on priorities
              and making policing more responsive to the needs of the community by, for example,
              establishing police-public bodies, such as public safety councils, to promote community
              safety. Policing approaches and operational priorities that are developed with the community
              are likely to serve the public safety needs of the local population better and, in turn, foster
              communities’ trust in police services.

              Both judicial and non-judicial mechanisms are used to
              address grievances, human rights violations, abuses, and mass atrocities committed during a
              conflict, with the aim of ending impunity and dealing with associated trauma. Transitional
              justice mechanisms are used when established judicial mechanisms are lacking in either
              capacity, knowledge or ability, or when they become necessary for reconciliation and for
              safeguarding   a   perception   of   independence   and   impartiality.   Typical   mechanisms   of
              transitional justice include truth commissions, criminal prosecutions in national courts or e.g.
              the International Court of Justice, institutional development, mediation, support for dialogue
              or programmes of reparations.
