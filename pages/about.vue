            <h1>Effects of peace operations</h1>
            <p class="about-intro-text">Typically, the underlying objective of a peace operation is reducing the conflict dynamics in the area
                of operation, including by preventing violent conflict, increasing stability and protecting civilians, and
                building   and   fostering   sustainable   peace.   The   following   is   a   non-exhaustive   list   of   possible
                contributions a peace operation can make to promote these objectives, many of which can be among
                the   mandated   tasks   of   a   peace   operation.   Not   all   peace   operations   attempt   to   make   all   these
                contributions; the list is simply intended to suggest contributions that a researcher might look for in
                each case in order to help answer the question: 
                <b>what effects did the peace operation produce?</b>

                <b>Preventing Conflict:</b> 
                Prevention can take different shapes, comprise a wide range of actions
                and address conflict at different stages:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <i>Preventing/averting imminent escalation</i>
                    or outbreak of violence (direct prevention) means 
                    preventing disputes from escalating into conflict, including mediation and local
                    conflict management e.g. leading or supporting national and local cease-fire or peace
                    agreements, supporting local peace agreements and local peace committees.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i>Preventing the recurrence</i>
                      of conflict entails taking deterrent action to support a
                      cease-fire or truce implementation mechanisms and other forms of deterrence to
                      prevent recurrence of conflict.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i>Indirect or structural prevention</i>, i.e. actions, steps or initiatives the peace operation
                    has taken to influence the underlying structural causes that generate risks to the civilian population.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="2">
                <b>Building confidence:</b> 
                Most activities of peace operations serve the underlying purpose of
                building confidence, i.e. to contribute to an environment that is conducive to fostering and
                increasing mutual confidence between the conflict parties or even within parties. Following a
                conflict, mistrust among communities and conflict parties may need to be dismantled before
                confidence can be developed. Confidence building is a key mechanism for repairing societal
                bonds after conflict and can be pursued through dialogue processes, capacity building or
                advocacy.
              </li>
              <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="3">
                <b>Stabilisation:</b> 
                Enhancing stability is a core function of any peace operation, and includes how
                the presence and actions of a peace operation contribute to 
                creating and maintaining a more
                secure environment at local,
                national and regional levels. Ensuring a secure environment is
                particularly relevant in areas where there may be residual conflict-related violence. In some
                cases, this may involve 
                actions to counter, disrupt or neutralise armed groups.
              </li>
              <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="4">
                <b>Protecting civilians:</b> 
                Since 1999, many peace operations have focused on the protection of
                civilians (PoC). PoC is a whole-of-mission endeavour where all components – military, police,
                and civilian – contribute to the implementation of the PoC mandate. PoC goes beyond
                protecting   civilians   from   immediate   physical   harm   through  
                deterrence,   intervention   or offensive   operations
                and includes protection through dialogue and engagement, e.g.
                supporting   of  political  processes  or   conflict  management   and  reconciliation,   as  well  as
                creating protective environments by maintaining law and order or strengthening host-state
                security services that respect human rights and the rule of law. 
              </li>
              <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="5">
                <b>Strengthening public safety:</b> 
                Beyond the mere protection from crime, as this also refers to
                the welfare of the general public, including a range of issues such as traffic safety, harassment
                or natural disasters. Safeguarding public safety and a secure environment has been a core
                mandated task from the early days of peacekeeping and is based on the rationale that people
                will be more willing to engage in a peace process if there is some guarantee of their safety. For
                people living in (post)conflict areas, feeling safe is linked to the provision of public safety
                either through national security providers or the presence of an international peace operation. 
                <i>Through which activities and engagements does the peace operation aim to strengthen public
                safety? How have these affected the perception of public safety?</i>
              </li>
              <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="6">
                <b>Promoting   human   rights:</b> 
                Conflicts   are   often   accompanied   by   serious   human   rights
                violations and impunity for the perpetrators. Peace operations engage in a host of activities,
                ranging from protecting and promoting  
                human rights through long-term measures, such as
                strengthening human rights laws and associated legal practices, to reduce impunity and
                address associated grievances.
                As part of their shorter-term protection and stabilisation remit,
                tasks include monitoring human rights, empowering populations to demand respect for their
                rights, and enabling government institutions to fulfil their human rights commitments.
              </li>
              <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="7">
                <b>Preventing CRSV and SGBV:</b> 
                The protection of women and men from sexual and gender-
                based/conflict-related sexual violence (SGBV/CRSV) during and after armed conflict is an
                essential part of the UN’s protection agenda. Preventing and addressing SGBV/CRSV is an
                integrated and prioritised element in a peace operation’s protection strategy.

              <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="9">
                <b>Promoting national reconciliation:</b> 
                National reconciliation  creates a  foundation  for  the
                lasting settlement of conflicts and is often a key element of the political process. While peace
                operations can provide the space (political or security) for a reconciliation process to take
                place, the process is unlikely to succeed unless national counterparts carry it forward and it is
                structured to address concerns, fears, and grievances of the population (see also
                ‘people-centred approaches’).
              </li>
              <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="10">
                <b>Contributing to peace dividends:</b> 
                Peace dividends are the benefits accrued by the population
                from a peace process or peace operation. More immediate peace dividends can contribute to
                confidence in the political process and 
                in the ability of communities to co-exist, as well as
                delivering tangible improvements for the population.
              </li>
              <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="11">
                <b>Extension   of   State  Authority   (ESA):</b> 
                Extending   or   restoring   state   authority   means
                strengthening the state presence in more remote areas where the state has not been present or
                has been unable to deliver basic public goods. In the context of protection and stabilisation,
                the extension of state authority is often related to public safety and access to justice. Peace
                operations’ efforts on ESA often consist of building host-state institutions, particularly in the
                security and justice sectors, strengthening the rule of law and supporting community policing.   
              </li>
              <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="12">
                <b>Supporting institution building and development:</b> 
                Weak  institutions  and  poor   service
                delivery are both causes and consequences of conflict. Conflict aggravates the fragility of
                institutions, which are no longer able to function properly or take care of the day-to-day
                governing of the country. Institutions may also be bloated, lack capacity or be poorly managed
                or structured. Peace operations have increasingly taken on institution building in the areas of
                rule of law, in the security sector or as part of the extension of state authority. The aim is to
                empower host-state authorities to be effective national owners and drivers of a peace process.
                Institution building also forms part of an operation’s protection strategy, as institutions capable
                of protecting their own citizens are part of establishing a protective environment. Sustainable
                institution building requires resources (both financial and human) but also time. 
              </li>
              <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="13">
                <b>Reforming/developing the security sector:</b> 
                Ultimately, sustainable peace requires a security
                sector that is effective and is based on the rule of law. The security sector not only comprises
                uniformed personnel, but multiple structures and institutions that are responsible for their
                recruitment, management and oversight. And yet security-sector reform (SSR) goes beyond
                institutional development to also assist in the formulation of national security strategies and
                other policy and planning documents, as well as in fostering effective cooperative structures
                across   the   sector.   SSR   often   takes   a   comprehensive   approach,   also   engaging   with
                parliamentary oversight committees, civil society, and, at times, informal or non-state security
                providers.
              </li>
              <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="14">
                <b>Promoting the rule of law:</b> 
                One element of promoting the rule of law addresses local
                institutions in the areas of justice, police, and corrections. But it also entails supporting the
                development, adoption and promulgation of legislation as well as in some cases drafting
                constitutions. For the population, access to justice is the fundamental concern and is often
                linked to the extension of state authority. A number of rule of law issues fuel conflict, such as
                disputed property and land rights or crime related to natural resources.
              </li>
              <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="15">
                <b>Supporting community policing:</b> 
                Strengthening the relationship between host-state police
                and the communities they serve is central to fostering a protective environment that can ensure
                public safety in the long run. In addition to longer-term capacity and institution building
                support, community policing seeks involvement of communities in discussions on priorities
                and making policing more responsive to the needs of the community by, for example,
                establishing police-public bodies, such as public safety councils, to promote community
                safety. Policing approaches and operational priorities that are developed with the community
                are likely to serve the public safety needs of the local population better and, in turn, foster
                communities’ trust in police services.

              <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="16">
                <b>Supporting transitional justice:</b> 
                Both judicial and non-judicial mechanisms are used to
                address grievances, human rights violations, abuses, and mass atrocities committed during a
                conflict, with the aim of ending impunity and dealing with associated trauma. Transitional
                justice mechanisms are used when established judicial mechanisms are lacking in either
                capacity, knowledge or ability, or when they become necessary for reconciliation and for
                safeguarding   a   perception   of   independence   and   impartiality.   Typical   mechanisms   of
                transitional justice include truth commissions, criminal prosecutions in national courts or e.g.
                the International Court of Justice, institutional development, mediation, support for dialogue
                or programmes of reparations.
