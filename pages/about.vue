          <h1>Two core objectives of effectiveness</h1>
          <p class="about-intro-text">The underlying two core objectives of a peace operation are preventing violent conflict,
            increasing stability and protecting civilians and building and fostering sustainable peace. The
            following is a non-exhaustive list of possible contributions a peace operation can make to
            promote the two core objectives, many of which can be among the mandated tasks of a peace
            operation.

          <ul>
            <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="1">
              <b>Preventing Conflict:</b> 
              Prevention can take different forms, comprise a wide range of actions
              and address conflict at different stages:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Preventing/<span class="ulined">averting imminent escalation</span></b>
                  or outbreak of violence (direct prevention) means 
                  preventing disputes from escalating into conflict, including mediation and local
                  conflict management, e.g. leading or supporting national and local cease-fire or peace
                  agreements, supporting local peace agreements and local peace committees.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b><span class="ulined">Preventing the recurrence</span></b>
                    of conflict entails taking deterrent action to support a
                    cease-fire or truce implementation mechanisms and other forms of deterrence to
                    prevent recurrence of conflict.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Indirect or <span class="ulined">structural prevention</span>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="2">
              <b>Building confidence:</b> 
              Most activities of peace operations serve the underlying purpose of
              building confidence, i.e. to contribute to an environment that is conducive to fostering and
              increasing mutual confidence between the conflict parties or even within parties. Following a
              conflict, mistrust among communities and conflict parties may need to be dismantled before
              confidence can be developed. Confidence building is a key mechanism for repairing societal
              bonds after conflict and can be pursued through dialogue processes, capacity building or
              advocacy.
            </li>
            <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="3">
              <b>Stabilisation:</b> 
              Enhancing stability is a core function of any peace operation, and includes how
              the presence and actions of a peace operation contribute to 
              creating and maintaining a more
              secure environment at local,
              national and regional levels. Ensuring a secure environment is
              particularly relevant in areas where there may be residual conflict-related violence. In some
              cases, this may involve 
              actions to counter, disrupt or neutralise armed groups.
            </li>
            <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="4">
              <b>Protecting civilians:</b> 
              PoC is a whole-of-mission endeavour 
              where all components – military,
              police, and civilian – contribute to the implementation of the PoC mandate. PoC
              goes beyond
              protecting   civilians   from   immediate   physical   harm   through  
              deterrence,   intervention   or
              offensive   operations
                and   includes   protection   through   dialogue   and   engagement,  
              e.g.
              supporting   of  political  processes  or   conflict  management   and  reconciliation,   as  well  as
              creating protective environments by maintaining law and order or strengthening host-state
              security services that respect human rights and the rule of law. 
            </li>
            <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="5">
              <b>Strengthening public safety:</b> 
              Beyond protection from crime, strengthening public safety also
              refers to the welfare of the general public, including a range of issues such as traffic safety,
              harassment or natural disasters. Safeguarding public safety and a secure environment as a core
              mandated task is based on the rationale that people will be more willing to engage in a peace
              process if there is some guarantee of their safety.
            </li>
            <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="6">
              <b>Promoting   human   rights:</b> 
              Conflicts   are   often   accompanied   by   serious   human   rights
              violations and impunity for the perpetrators. A whole range of activities from short-term to
              long-term   is   carried   out   by   peace   operations.   These   include   monitoring   human   rights,
              strengthening human rights laws, empowering populations to demand respect for their rights,
              and enabling government institutions to fulfil their human rights commitments.
            </li>
            <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="7">
              <b>Preventing CRSV and SGBV:</b> 
              The protection of women and men from sexual and gender-
              based/conflict-related sexual violence (SGBV/CRSV) during and after the armed conflict is an
              essential part of the UN’s protection agenda. Preventing and addressing SGBV/CRSV is an
              integrated and prioritised element in a peace operation’s protection strategy.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="8">2. Building and fostering sustainable peace</h2>
          <ul>
            <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="9">
              <b>Promoting national reconciliation:</b> 
              National reconciliation  creates a  foundation  for  the
              lasting settlement of conflicts and is often a key element of the political process. While peace
              operations can provide the space (political or security) for a reconciliation process to take
              place, the process is unlikely to succeed unless national counterparts carry it forward and it is
              structured to address concerns, fears, and grievances of the population (see also ‘people-
              centred approaches’). 
            </li>
            <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="10">
              <b>Contributing to peace dividends:</b> 
              Peace dividends are the benefits accrued by the population
              from a peace process or peace operation. More immediate peace dividends can contribute to
              confidence in the political process and 
              in the ability of communities to co-exist,
              as well as
              delivering tangible improvements for the population. 
            </li>
            <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="11">
              <b>Extension   of   State  Authority   (ESA):</b> 
              Extending   or   restoring   state   authority   means
              strengthening the state presence in more remote areas where the state has not been present or
              has been unable to deliver basic public goods. The extension of state authority is often related
              to public safety and access to justice. Peace operations’ efforts on ESA often consist of
              building host-state institutions, particularly in the security and justice sectors, strengthening
              the rule of law and supporting community policing.  
            </li>
            <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="12">
              <b>Supporting institution building and development:</b> 
              Weak  institutions  and  poor   service
              delivery are both causes and consequences of conflict. Conflict aggravates the fragility of
              institutions, which are no longer able to function properly or take care of the day-to-day
              governing of the country. Institutions may also be bloated, lack capacity or be poorly managed
              or structured. Peace operations have increasingly taken on institution building in the areas of
              the rule of law, in the security sector or as part of the extension of state authority. The aim is to
              empower host-state authorities to be effective national owners and drivers of a peace process. 
            </li>
            <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="13">
              <b>Reforming/developing the security sector:</b> 
              Sustainable peace requires a security sector that
              is effective and is based on the rule of law. The security sector not only comprises uniformed
              personnel, but multiple structures and institutions that are responsible for their recruitment,
              management  and  oversight.  Security-sector  reform  (SSR)  thus  goes  beyond  institutional
              development to also assist in the formulation of national security strategies and other policy
              and planning documents.
            </li>
            <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="14">
              <b>Promoting the rule of law:</b> 
              A key element of promoting the rule of law addresses local
              institutions in the areas of justice, police, and corrections. Rule of Law also entails supporting
              the development, adoption and promulgation of legislation as well as in some cases drafting
              constitutions. For the population, access to justice is the fundamental concern and is often
              linked to the extension of state authority. A number of rule of law issues fuel conflict, such as
              disputed property and land rights or crime related to natural resources.
            </li>
            <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="15">
              <b>Supporting community policing:</b> 
              Strengthening the relationship between host-state police
              and the communities they serve is central to fostering a protective environment that can ensure
              public safety in the long run. 
            </li>
            <li class="about-getpos" data-nav-id="16">
              <b>Supporting transitional justice:</b> 
              Both judicial and non-judicial mechanisms are used to
              address grievances, human rights violations, abuses, and mass atrocities committed during a
              conflict, with the aim of ending impunity and dealing with associated trauma. Transitional
              justice mechanisms, e.g. mediation, reparations truth commissions, criminal prosecutions,
              International Court of Justice,  are used when established judicial mechanisms are lacking in
              either capacity, knowledge or ability, or when they become necessary for reconciliation and
              for safeguarding a perception of independence and impartiality.
